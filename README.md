🧠 Glioma Grade & Survival Prediction (ML Project)
📌 Overview

This project applies machine learning to predict glioma grades and estimate patient survival outcomes using clinical and molecular data. The goal is to support better diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment strategies through data-driven models.

🎯 Objectives

Preprocess and analyze glioma dataset.

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Train multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).

Evaluate performance with standard metrics.

Identify key clinical and molecular features influencing predictions.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost, matplotlib, seaborn

Notebook: Jupyter (Ml_code.ipynb)

Dataset: GLM DATASET.xlsx

📊 Workflow

Load and preprocess dataset.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

Train ML models for grade classification and survival prediction.

Evaluate with accuracy, ROC-AUC, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

Analyze feature importance for biological insights.

📈 Results (Sample)

Best model: XGBoost — Achieved XX% accuracy and YY ROC-AUC.

Important features included Age, Tumor Grade, [Top Genes].
